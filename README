Download and build Linux kernel source from kernel.org

-   Has 'one-touch' default behavior
-   Behavior can be customized using environment variables

DEFAULT behavior:

-   Kernel source is downloaded and built in CURRENT DIRECTORY (not
    necessarily where patch_and_build_kernel.sh is)
-   Will automatically download and build the LATEST kernel
-   Will automatically upgrade kernel config when moving to next major
    version
    -   For new config entries:
        -   Anything that can become a module will be modularized
        -   Everything else gets the DEFAULT value
-   DEBS will be built in a sub-directory named 'debs' under CURRENT
    DIRECTORY (not necessarily where patch_and_build_kernel.sh is)
-   The 'debs' directory will be deleted and re-created if it exists
-   Will use config.kernel in the directory patch_and_build_kernel.sh is
-   Defaults to using (available_cores -1) cores
-   config.prefs in directory where patch_and_build_kernel.sh is can
    contain name=value pairs that will be applied to the config while
    building

Things that can be changed using environment variables:

See samples/sample_kernel.config for a list of environment variables
that can be set, their default values and meanings

The additional environment variable KERNEL_BUILD_CONFIG can be set to
point at the config file to be sourced - defaults to
~/.kernel_build.config.

If you are uploading to bintray, see samples/sample_bintray.config for a
list of environment variables that MUST be set for upload to work.

The additional environment variable BINTRAY_CONFIG can be set to point
at bintray config file to source - defaults to ~/.bintray.config

config.prefs or KERNEL_CONFIG_PREFS format:

-   Lines starting with '#' are ignored
-   Blank lines are ignored
-   Valid lines should contain:
    name=value OR
    name = value
-   Regex is '^\s_(?P\S+)\s_=\s*(?P\S+)'

Packages required:

-   Run required_pkgs.sh in this directory to check and report missing
    packages
-   patch_and_build_kernel.sh automatically calls this when it runs
